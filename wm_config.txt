;Config file format
;
; wm_config.txt resides in sd:/wad, and it is optional. You will get all the 
;               prompts if you don't have this file.
; The param keywords are case-sensitive at this point.
; No spaces precede the keyword on a line
; If you don't have a password in the config file, the default is no password
; If you don't have a startupPath, the default is /wad
; If you don't have any of the other parameters, it will prompt you for it
; To bypass any of the params, just comment out the line using a ";" at the beginning of the line
; Blank lines are ignored.
